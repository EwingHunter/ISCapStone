The purpose of the Cloud Messaging Provider is to provide to a recipient, a collection of all messages between a Google publisher and subscription while flagging any duplicates. All this information will be set up in a UI that will feature a sorting system and highlight said duplicated messages. The messages sent need to be saved inside of a database before being handled for duplicated messages. The steps of the process will be being with setting up connectivity to the cloud messaging provider then creating the components that will write and read messages coming from the messaging topic. These messages will be retained and sent to a database, most likely MySQL or MongoDB, and saved. Getting access to the database will then allow us to parse the data sent through a JSON file to find a duplicated message ID which is the key to filtering duplicated messages. On a separate end, we will produce a UI that will display the messages saved in the database and will highlight the duplicated messages which includes all the information of value saved in the JSON file such as item ID, location or quantity. Other features that will be implemented include a sorting and filtering capability to the UI to search for specific item IDâ€™s or transaction numbers.
